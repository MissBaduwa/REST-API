# REST-API
Node.js Express REST API project that allows users to fetch user data based on ID, profession, and name. Includes Postman tests and screenshots for validation

Overview of the RESTful API Project Project
This project is an application built with Node.js and Express that uses a RESTful API to get user information from a JSON file. There are endpoints in the API that allow you to retrieve specific users by name, occupation, or ID, as well as all users.

Goals
Use Express to create a REST API.
To read and parse JSON data, utilize the Node.js fs module.
Create and evaluate GET routes to get particular user information.

What I Learned During this Project:

How to configure API endpoints and set up a server using Express.
Managing JSON data in a Node.js application by using the fs module.
GitHub and Git version control best practices.
I also provided thorough comments throughout the codebase to help me understand and remember the code. It is easier to examine and maintain the code later on thanks to these comments, which serve to make clear the purpose of each function and line.

This project contatins a folder named /TESTING which has all the testing screenshots showing the functionality of the API.

Discussion
My understanding REST API design and Node.js development has improved as a result of working on this project. I ran into some issues with Git setup and routing, but I was able to fix them with practice and troubleshooting. My comprehension was further enhanced by the addition of comments throughout the code, which improved the code's readability for future reference and helped me recall what each component did.
